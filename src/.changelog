# Dockside Source Changelog

This file tracks source edits made in this workspace and should be continuously updated after every edit batch.

## Update Rule
- Add a new entry at the top under `Edit Log` for each completed edit batch.
- Include: scope, files touched, and outcome.
- Keep prior entries unchanged except to correct factual errors.

## Edit Log

### Edit 005 - Remaining-Issues Hardening Pass
**Scope**
- Addressed the follow-up architectural risk list after Edit 004.
- Focused on VerbSlot machine stability, queue deadlock recovery, and store contract safety.

**Files Updated**
- `src/components/VerbSlot.tsx`
- `src/machines/verbSlot.machine.ts`
- `src/store/gameStore.ts`
- `src/store/verbStore.ts`
- `src/ecs/systems/verb.system.ts`
- `src/store/__tests__/verbStore.test.ts`

**Key Results**
- `VerbSlot` no longer rebuilds its XState machine when `onComplete` callback identity changes.
- Completion emission moved to a guarded React effect keyed to cooldown state + token context.
- Added inflight batch timeout fallback in `gameStore` (`VERB_INFLIGHT_MAX_TICKS`) to prevent permanent queue deadlock.
- Added explicit single-thread assumption comment in `verbStore` acknowledge filtering.
- Removed module-level `VerbSystem` singleton export to avoid accidental no-op usage.
- Added dedicated `verbStore` tests for peek/acknowledge behavior and non-destructive acknowledgment.

### Edit 004 - Phase 3 Stability and Architecture Corrections
**Scope**
- Resolved critical architecture and correctness issues raised in deep review.
- Shifted board rendering to ECS-driven snapshot cards and hardened runtime/store integration.

**Files Updated**
- `src/components/MurderBoard.tsx`
- `src/components/Card.tsx`
- `src/components/VerbSlot.tsx`
- `src/machines/verbSlot.machine.ts`
- `src/store/gameStore.ts`
- `src/store/verbStore.ts`
- `src/ecs/world.ts`
- `src/ecs/systems/verb.system.ts`
- `src/ecs/systems/__tests__/verb.system.test.ts`

**Key Results**
- Murder Board header copy now reflects Phase 3 live runtime state.
- Board cards are now sourced from ECS `FoundationSnapshot.boardCards` (via Zustand), not static `PHASE_TWO_BOARD_CARDS` fixtures.
- Work/Scheme resolution now uses pure outcome calculation with centralized ECS effect application.
- Added Scheme resolution path with explicit cash/heat outcomes and tests.
- Completion dispatch moved into XState machine cooldown entry for one-time firing per cycle.
- Added strict token guard for `DROP_CARD` effect to prevent duplicate sends in Strict Mode behavior.
- Replaced verb queue dequeue-and-clear with peek + acknowledge flow to avoid read/clear race windows.
- Added global singleton strategy in `gameStore` to reduce HMR ghost-loop risk.
- Heat lens thresholds now derive from HeatSystem tier logic instead of ad-hoc weighted constants.
- Snapshot now includes ECS-projected board cards; location IDs are normalized for robust district matching.
- Street-wire seed entries are cleared on successful simulation boot.
- Initial zoom defaults now match min zoom baseline to avoid first-frame zoom snap.

### Edit 003 - Phase 3 ECS <-> UI Bridge (commit: d53f9e3)
**Scope**
- Connected ECS simulation state to React via Zustand.
- Added UI -> ECS verb action queueing and ECS verb resolution.
- Wired Work verb end-to-end and added heat lens visual mapping.

**Files Added**
- `src/store/gameStore.ts`
- `src/store/verbStore.ts`
- `src/ecs/systems/verb.system.ts`
- `src/ecs/systems/__tests__/verb.system.test.ts`

**Files Updated**
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/components/MurderBoard.tsx`
- `src/components/VerbSlot.tsx`
- `src/components/Card.tsx`
- `src/ecs/world.ts`
- `src/ecs/systems/resource.system.ts`
- `src/styles/murder-board.css`

**Key Results**
- `gameStore` boots `bootDocksideSimulation` once and exposes reactive `FoundationSnapshot` data.
- `onTick` handling is debounced with `requestAnimationFrame` semantics.
- `verbStore` now carries completed verb actions from UI timers.
- New `VerbSystem` consumes queued actions each tick and resolves outcomes.
- Work verb resolution implemented: valid location work increments Jeffries cash.
- Event log receives verb resolution lines through store callbacks.
- Card heat lens classes now respond to local/federal heat values.
- `ResourceSystem` no longer depends on `timeQuery.getFirst()`.
- Validation completed: lint/test/build passing.

### Edit 002 - Phase 2 Interaction, Layout, and Readability Pass
**Scope**
- Improved board interaction quality and visual clarity.
- Fixed drag/drop behavior issues and card replacement behavior.
- Improved no-scroll viewport fit and reduced text blur while zooming.

**Files Updated (major)**
- `src/components/MurderBoard.tsx`
- `src/components/Card.tsx`
- `src/components/VerbSlot.tsx`
- `src/machines/verbSlot.machine.ts`
- `src/styles/murder-board.css`
- `src/index.css`

**Key Results**
- Board interaction supports freeform placement and panning without text selection.
- Strict slot collision logic requires true overlap, not loose horizontal alignment.
- Dropping a card into an occupied slot replaces the prior card assignment.
- Card back includes editable notes and a visible Flip Back button.
- Dragged cards render above surrounding panels and snap back if dropped off-canvas.
- Custom scrollbar styling added for slot/event/card-back scroll regions.
- Zoom implementation adjusted for readability and smoother clarity behavior.
- Page-level scrolling prevented while preserving board interactivity.

### Edit 001 - Phase 2 Murder Board Foundation
**Scope**
- Built the initial static Murder Board UI scaffold and interactions.

**Files Added/Updated (major)**
- `src/components/MurderBoard.tsx`
- `src/components/Card.tsx`
- `src/components/VerbSlot.tsx`
- `src/components/EventLog.tsx`
- `src/machines/verbSlot.machine.ts`
- `src/data/cards/phase2.board.ts`
- `src/styles/murder-board.css`

**Key Results**
- Introduced board canvas, draggable cards, verb slots, and event log presentation.
- Added XState verb-slot machine with timer/cooldown behaviors.
- Added dnd-kit integration for card-to-slot interactions.
- Established noir visual language and board component structure.
